# DSCI-475 : Topological Data Analysis
Topological techniques for analyzing high-dimensional or complex data. The shape of data may reflect patterns within; e.g. connected components may correspond to groupings, or a circular shape may correspond to periodic behavior. Topics include clustering, dendrograms, a visual introduction to topology, data modeling and visualization, and selected topics from nonlinear dimensionality reduction, graph-based models of data, Reeb graphs, multi-scale approaches to data, and persistent homology.

Includes Final Project on Sliding Window Embedding + Write-Up which was done with the help of 3 other classmates.
